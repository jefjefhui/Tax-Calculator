Tax Calculator 
The tax calculator is a program which takes users salary amount and marital status as input. Afterwards, it will calculate the payable tax amount and show it to the user.
The flow of the program is quite simple. When the program starts, it will ask your gross income. After entering the gross income, the system will ask for your marital status. For the marital status, you can choose single, married joint, married separately, and head of household. Users need to select the correct marital status for the correct result. When everything is entered correctly, the program will show the payable tax amount, and the program ends.
